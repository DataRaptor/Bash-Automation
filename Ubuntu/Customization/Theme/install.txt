sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions
sudo apt-get install gnome-tweaks



There are two places the themes files can be placed:

~/.themes : You may have to create this folder in your home directory if it doesnâ€™t exist. The themes placed here will be available only to you (the logged in user)
/usr/share/themes: The themes put in this folder will be available to all the users on your system. You need to be root to put files in this folder.
